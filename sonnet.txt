Apache Spark, a wonder of our time,
A tool for big data, swift and sure,
With power to process mountains of mime
And bring insights beyond what was obscure.

With its in-memory processing so grand,
It makes analysis lightning fast and bright,
And with its cluster manager at command,
It conquers tasks of great complexity and might.

From machine learning to streaming, too,
It handles it all with skill and finesse,
With APIs for Java, Python, and new
It broadens the scope of analytics to impress.

Apache Spark, a true work of art,
A shining example of technology's heart.
